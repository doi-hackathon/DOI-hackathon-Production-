                                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people across our region. The DFW metroplex has had over 150,000 cases of COVID-19, and many of these cases have occurred in younger people. Those who are younger may feel fine and not have any symptoms, but may be unknowingly spreading the virus to their friends and family because of it. This makes it especially important for teenagers and young adults to be aware of the risks of the virus and to have a good understanding of how it is impacting our communities.</p>
                                    <p>The COVID-19 Student Data Challenge is an opportunity for you and other students from our area to analyze real data-sets to learn more about COVID-19 and what’s happening in the Dallas area. By participating in the challenge, not only will you learn more about data skills and have a chance to win a prize, you will also have the opportunity to help spread awareness of COVID-19 and keep our schools and communities safe.</p>
                                    <p>Your task is to complete an analysis of any combination of data-sets provided and to communicate insights that you’ve learned about COVID-19 through the data. This analysis can be submitted as  Powerpoint, a dashboard, a written document, or any other format of communicating this information. The only rule is that submissions are capped at 10 pages maximum, including any charts and code. We encourage you to use visuals as needed to explain your information.</p>
                                    <h3>Submissions will be judged on the following criteria:</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Data Management: how effectively you used data</li>
                                        <li>Creativity: how innovatively you used the data</li>
                                        <li>Analysis: how thoughtful and insightful your results were</li>
                                        <li>Visualization: how effective your data visualizations were</li>
                                        <li>Coding: how well you used code to generate results</li>

                                    <p>To help you with these projects, we will be providing optional mentorship appointments to get help from a local professional. You don’t have to speak with a mentor to enter the challenge, but if you’re interested in doing so, click the “Find a Mentor” box under the mentorship section.</p>
                                    <p>Projects must be submitted in this portal by 11:59 pm on September 25th, 2020. Good luck!</p>

You can sign up for a mentor slot by clicking the “Find a Mentor” button below. This link will take you to a spreadsheet where you can sign up for a slot. Note: this spreadsheet will track any changes made to it, so please sign up for an empty slot and do not erase someone else’s name to take their slot. Doing so will mean you’ll be disqualified. Once you sign up, you’ll be given contact information for a mentor who is available during your timeslot. Please reach out to them to schedule your appointment.</p>

You can sign up for a mentor slot by clicking the “Find a Mentor” button below. This link will take you to a spreadsheet where you can sign up for a slot. Note: this spreadsheet will track any changes made to it, so please sign up for an empty slot and do not erase someone else’s name to take their slot. Doing so will mean you’ll be disqualified. Once you sign up, you’ll be given contact information for a mentor who is available during your timeslot. Please reach out to them to schedule your appointment.</p>
